    <h2 style="color: darkslategrey;">Amar Jawan Jyoti is a prominent war memorial located in New Delhi, India. It was inaugurated in 1972 to honor Indian soldiers who died in various conflicts, especially the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. The memorial is designed as a simple but powerful flame that burns continuously, symbolizing the eternal spirit of the soldiers.

        The Amar Jawan Jyoti features an eternal flame burning at the center of a black marble structure. Around the flame are four main pillars with the names of Indian soldiers inscribed on them. This structure serves as a place for people to pay their respects and remember the sacrifices made by the soldiers.
        
        The memorial is located near India Gate and is a significant site for national remembrance. On special occasions, like Independence Day and Republic Day, ceremonies are held at the Amar Jawan Jyoti to honor the bravery and sacrifice of the armed forces. It stands as a symbol of national pride and the enduring commitment to those who have served the country.
