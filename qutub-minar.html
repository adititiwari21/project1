    <h2 style="color: darkslategrey;">The Qutub Minar is a tall, ancient tower located in Delhi, India. It was built in the early 13th century by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the first ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, to celebrate his victory. The minaret stands at about 73 meters (240 feet) tall and is made of red sandstone with intricate carvings and inscriptions.

        The Qutub Minar is famous for its unique architectural style and beautiful decorations. It has five distinct sections, each getting smaller as you go up, with balconies and intricate patterns. The tower was originally intended to serve as a minaret for a mosque that was built nearby, but it has become a symbol of the rich history of Delhi.
        
        Surrounding the Qutub Minar is the Qutub Complex, which includes other historic buildings and ruins. Itâ€™s a popular tourist destination and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized for its historical significance and architectural beauty.
