    <h2 style="color: darkslategrey;">Mysore Palace is a grand and historic palace located in Mysore, Karnataka, India. It was originally built in the 14th century, but the current building was constructed in the early 20th century after a fire destroyed the old one. The palace is known for its stunning architecture, with its intricate carvings, colorful decorations, and large domes.

        Inside the Mysore Palace, you'll find beautifully decorated rooms and halls. The palace is filled with rich artwork, antique furniture, and ornate ceilings. It was once the residence of the Wadiyar royal family, and the rooms reflect their royal lifestyle. The palace is especially famous for its elaborate decorations during the annual Dussehra festival, when it is lit up with thousands of lights.
        
        Today, Mysore Palace is a popular tourist destination and a symbol of the city's royal heritage. It’s not just a historic site but also a vibrant part of Mysore’s cultural life. Visitors come to admire its beauty and learn about the history of the Wadiyar dynasty and their contributions to the region.
