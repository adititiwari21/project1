    <h2 style="color: darkslategrey;">The Elephanta Caves are a group of ancient rock-cut temples located on Elephanta Island, near Mumbai, India. These caves date back to around the 5th to 8th centuries and are famous for their impressive sculptures and carvings. The island is a short ferry ride from Mumbai, making it a popular day trip for tourists.

        The main attraction of the Elephanta Caves is the large sculpture of Lord Shiva, known as the Trimurti, which is carved into a rock face. This 20-foot-tall sculpture depicts three heads of Shiva, each representing different aspects of the deity. The caves also contain other smaller shrines and carvings that show various Hindu deities and scenes from Hindu mythology.
        
        Visitors to the Elephanta Caves can explore the intricate carvings and enjoy the natural beauty of the island. The caves are surrounded by lush greenery and offer a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai. They are also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized for their historical and cultural importance.
