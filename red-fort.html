    <h2 style="color: darkslategrey;">The Red Fort is a grand historical fortification located in Delhi, India. It was built in the 17th century by Emperor Shah Jahan, the same ruler who built the Taj Mahal. The fort is known for its massive red sandstone walls, which give it its distinctive color and name. It served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years.

        Inside the Red Fort, you'll find beautiful gardens, courtyards, and several impressive buildings like the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience) and the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience). The fort's architecture combines Persian, Timurid, and Indian styles, making it a stunning example of Mughal design.
        
        Today, the Red Fort is a major tourist attraction and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It also holds cultural and historical significance, as it's the site where the Prime Minister of India delivers a speech every Independence Day, marking the country's freedom from British rule.
