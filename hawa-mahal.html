    <h2 style="color: darkslategrey;">Hawa Mahal, also known as the "Palace of Winds," is a unique and beautiful building located in Jaipur, India. Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, it is known for its distinctive façade that looks like a honeycomb with numerous small windows. The purpose of these windows was to allow the royal women to observe street festivals and daily life without being seen themselves.

        The Hawa Mahal is made from pink sandstone and features intricate latticework that creates a stunning pattern. The design helps keep the building cool, as the breeze flows through the windows, which is why it’s called the "Palace of Winds." The building is a great example of Rajput architecture and reflects the artistic skills of the time.
        
        Today, Hawa Mahal is a popular tourist attraction in Jaipur. Visitors come to admire its unique architecture and explore its many small rooms and corridors. It’s not only a beautiful historical site but also an important symbol of Jaipur’s rich cultural heritage.
